<H2>T2 System Development Environment</H2>
<p><b>... more than a distribution next generation.</b></p>
<!--
<div class="right">
<IMG SRC="./t2-logo-medium.gif" ALT="T2 logo">
</div> -->

<p>T2 SDE is not just a common Linux distribution - it is a flexible Open
Source <I>System Development Environment</I> or <I>Distribution Build Kit</I>
(others might even name it Meta Distribution). T2 allows the creation of
custom distributions with state of the art technology, up-to-date packages and
integrated support for cross compilation. Currently the Linux kernel is
normally used - but the T2 SDE is being expanded to Minix, Hurd, OpenDarwin,
Haiku and OpenBSD - more to come.</p>

<div class="newsdate">2004-10-03</div>

<div class="newsbody">

The "T2" project tagged and released the internal milestone 2.1.0-alpha
("Way to heaven").<br>

Major changes from ROCK Linux 2.0 and 2.1 include: gcc-3.4.x used
exclusively, a "sanitized" linux-header package which currently uses
2.6.8.1 headers, X.Org is used exclusively, some packages got split
into individual ones (e.g. alsa, mad, ogg-vorbis and xine), the .desc
D tag for the cvs:// URL scheme got revisited, the ugly date encoding
via a '!' fot dropped in favor of more natural form as to be executed
manually on the command line, the .desc NODIST "hack" support was
removed, as well as the new CD tag not imported, the .desc tags CV-PAT
and CV-DEL support was dropped, many packages got updated and added,
no people named repositories - most packages should now be sorted into
category repositories - which so far scale quite well, no package fork
/ package split stuff, no pseudo cross native compiler hacks and no
perl cpan meta package fork whatever (tm) stuff, no default kernel
stuff - a "sanitized" linux-header package is always used (always as
up-to-date as possible - currently 2.6.8.1), no linux*-src packages -
third party modules will be build as part of any kernel package (will
be implemented next week ;-)
