Muh Dotfiles

These dotfiles are used by my auto ricing script [JARS](https://gitlab.com/Jacob_McDonnell/jars).

- ```~/.local/bin``` are my custom scripts

- Config files for:
	- Korn Shell

	- zsh with oh my zsh

	- xorg

	- BSPWM

	- Fontconfig

	- htop

	- neofetch

	- newsboat

	- polybar

	- SXHKD

	- vim

	- zathura

## .profile

.profile moves many files out of the home folder into sub folders

## The main Repo is on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/Jacob_McDonnell/dotfiles) but it is mirrored to [Github](https://github.com/JacobMcDonnell/dotfiles)
