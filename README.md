Muh Dotfiles

These dotfiles are used by my auto ricing script [JARS](https://gitlab.com/Jacob_McDonnell/jars).

- Config files for:
	- Korn Shell

	- zsh with oh my zsh
	- xorg

	- BSPWM

	- Fontconfig

	- htop

	- neofetch

	- newsboat

	- polybar

## .profile

.profile moves many files out of the home folder into sub folders
